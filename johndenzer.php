		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>I am a junior studying Financial Economics at the University of Rochester.  I am a huge fan of European soccer and I very much enjoy playing in my spare time.  I am hoping to break into the investment banking sector after graduation.</p>
		
		
		
		<h2>Experience</h2>
		
		<h3>Investment Banking - Exit Partners, LLC</h3>
			
			<p>I worked as a summer analsyt focusing on typical day to day work of an investment banker.  I edited CIMs, created pitchbooks, and worked on financial modeling for the firm's clients. </p>
		
		<h3>Computer Building - Jack's PCs</h3>
		
			<p>I started a small business focused on building in home desktops for clients.  I was involved in the planning, building and installing portions of the sales. </p>
			
		<h3>Philanthropy - Young Men's Service Leauge</h3>
		
			<p>I worked as the President of a Dallas based philanthropy focused on helping special needs children and working with them in a school like environment.</p>
		 
		<h2>Extracurriculars</h2> 

		<p>I have played baseball now for 15 years or so and it was my lifelong dream to play college baseball and luckily I was given that opportunity when I came to the University of Rochester.  I am a right handed starting pitcher and I actually set a school record this last season for least amount of walks per nine innings pitched.  I also was 2nd in the NCAA for the same stat this last season. I love baseball and I hope the last two seasons of my career do not go too quickly.  I am very interested in sports and in computers.  I follow European soccer very closely and I am an avid computer builder.  I am a huge Tottenham Hotspur fan and follow the news religiously regarding what is going on with them currently.  I enjoy following tech news as well and one of my favorite companies is AMD and I love following how their stock moves so quickly in the market due to their contributions to the semiconductor space. </p>
