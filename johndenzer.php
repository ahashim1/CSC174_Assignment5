		<h3>My Schoolwork</h3>
		<p>I have taken classes primarily in the Economics, Finance and Computer Science worlds.  Some of the Economics classes include ECO 108, 207, 209, 230, 231w and I am currently a Teaching Assistant for ECO 207.  I have taken Accounting 201 and am currently taking Finance 205.  In the Computer Science world, I have taken CSC 170, 171, 172 and now 174.  I am looking to leverage my classwork in Computer Science to make myself look like a more applicable candidate for investment banking roles. My favorite class that I have taken is ECO 207 as I undersood it and really enjoyed the professor's lectures. </p>
		
		<h3>My Baseball Career</h3>
		<p>I have played baseball now for 15 years or so and it was my lifelong dream to play college baseball and luckily I was given that opportunity when I came to the University of Rochester.  I am a right handed starting pitcher and I actually set a school record this last season for least amount of walks per nine innings pitched.  I also was 2nd in the NCAA for the same stat this last season. I love baseball and I hope the last two seasons of my career do not go too quickly.</p>
		
		<h3>My Interests</h3>
		<p>I am very interested in sports and in computers.  I follow European soccer very closely and I am an avid computer builder.  I am a huge Tottenham Hotspur fan and follow the news religiously regarding what is going on with them currently.  I enjoy following tech news as well and one of my favorite companies is AMD and I love following how their stock moves so quickly in the market due to their contributions to the semiconductor space. </p>
